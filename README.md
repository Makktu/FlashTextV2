TARGETS

## W/E Friday 18 Oct 2024

Fully functional Alpha.

## W/E Friday 25 Oct 2024

Polished final version 1.0.

Devlog:

### Mon 7 Oct

Reconnected with the project, refreshed, etc. This must not look like an app from 2010, as the first one did. Scrolling will be challenging. (I dropped scrolling from the first version when I couldn't get it to work.) The colour scheme will be tricky, but more fiddly than difficult, as such. I tend not to want to do the granular, fairly routine stuff that I know how to do (such as implementing a proper colour scheme picker) -- but that is probably 90% of all programming.

### Tues 8 Oct 2024

Targets:

- Decide on overall design. Am I including Tabbed navigation just because I want to gain experience with it? This could still be a one-screen app.
- Implement basics of colour scheme picker.
- Finalise where and how the likes of History will pop up. I.e. as a modal or a separate screen. AND implement first draft of it.

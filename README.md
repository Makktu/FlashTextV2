Scrolling messages (as well as Flash).

Same Privacy settings -- it is a self-contained app whose data does not go anywhere else.

TARGETS

## W/E Friday 18 Oct 2024

Fully functional Alpha.

## W/E Friday 25 Oct 2024

Polished final version 1.0.

Devlog:

### Mon 7 Oct

Reconnected with the project, refreshed, etc. This must not look like an app from 2010, as the first one did. Scrolling will be challenging. (I dropped scrolling from the first version when I couldn't get it to work.) The colour scheme will be tricky, but more fiddly than difficult, as such. I tend not to want to do the granular, fairly routine stuff that I know how to do (such as implementing a proper colour scheme picker) -- but that is probably 90% of all programming.

### Tues 8 Oct 2024

Targets:

- Decide on overall design. Am I including Tabbed navigation just because I want to gain experience with it? This could still be a one-screen app.
- Implement basics of colour scheme picker.
- Finalise where and how the likes of History will pop up. I.e. as a modal or a separate screen. AND implement first draft of it.

Tabbed screens OUT -- modal Settings screen IN. Not really working yet.
Theme picker button added (not working yet).
History will also be on the modal.

### Weds 9 October 2024

Added full Flash/Scroll screen change functionality.
Started on sensing device orientation.

### Thur 10 October 2024

Got screen orientation working. Responds to live user choice. No longer locked to a Settings choice. (Give user option to control it from a setting in final version?)

### Mon 14 October 2024

Nothing today.

### Tue 15 October 2024

Added Reanimation library and started to learn it.

### Thu 5 December 2024

Might have finally got dynamic font working.

More testing required on real devices. iPad and iPhone.

All being well, this is what's left to do:

1: Make Swoosh default to 1.5s timer (or all?). ✅
2: Improve display for text input bar on iPad. ✅
3: Make first animation default to Stretch. ✅
4: Create proper app icon. ✅
5: Fix iPad display when user opens app in Landscape. ✅

### Mon 9 December 2024

All of the above things are now done.

### Tue 10 December 2024

Next up:

Testing on real devices. ✅
Any final tinkering & testing required. ✅
Creating screenshots across various devices and orientations for the App Store.
Publish.
